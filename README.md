# Face Masks Game ðŸ’– âœ¨

### by Ashley Rice

I redid the game in an HTML file instead of having a separate file for JavaScript so that you can play it in the browser via GitHub Pages.

## Overview

This is a simple, interactive web-based game where players can try different face masks on a character named Penelope. The game is designed to be fun, creative, and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Game Components

### Background
- The game is set on a webpage with a blue background.

### Character
- The main character, Penelope, is also moveable on the blue screen.


### Face Masks
There are 4 unique face masks, each with its own color and fabric design:
- A tie-dye patterned mask
- A solid blue mask
- A mask with a punch (drink) design
- A mask with a confetti pattern

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
- Each game element (character and masks) is wrapped in a `<div>` with a unique ID.
- Absolute positioning is used to place each element at a specific location on the screen.

### Interactivity
- JavaScript is implemented to make the masks draggable.
- Event listeners are added for both mouse and touch interactions, ensuring compatibility with desktop and mobile devices.

### Dragging Functionality
- When a mask is selected, the game tracks its starting position.
- As the player moves their cursor or finger, the mask's position is updated in real-time.
- Upon release, the mask remains in its new position.

## How to Play

1. Players can drag any of the colorful face masks onto Penelope's face.
2. Different masks can be tried on and removed to create various looks.
3. The game encourages creativity and fashion exploration through the variety of mask designs available.

## Compatibility

The game is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop computers and touch-enabled mobile devices.
